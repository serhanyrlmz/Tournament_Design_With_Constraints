Tournaments are competitive organizations that find the best teams or individuals from certain competitors. Elimination style tournaments are the tournaments that are based on the logic of eliminating less powerful teams or individuals stage by stage in order to obtain a winner at the end. Since every tournament-style depends on different circumstances, their success rates have to be different. In this project, the goal is to test whether the elimination tournament system gives the optimal success rate. With this project, it is investigated which parameters will give the optimal result in determining tournament winners according to variable factors in the actual tournaments. In order to do that, various Python programs that acquire the success rate of systems developed using libraries called “itertools” and “math” and their functions such as “permutations”, “combinations” and “factorial”. At the end of the project, lots of data to evaluate the elimination system with different circumstances were acquired. Results of programs are either explained verbally or given as charts. In conclusion, the elimination system is not a good way of sorting the teams especially for the teams in top-ranks and mid-ranks rather than worst teams. Because the chances of their rankings are very unstable and unpredictable in the elimination system. Also, the best team has a relatively small chance to win the tournament.
